# Wikidig
Wikidig is a simple Shell script for fetching a short summary about anything
from Wikipedia and display it nicely on your terminal.

In the following example, the given queries will lead you to a summary about
the best comedy group EVER.

    $ wikidig monty python      # plain
    $ wikidig 'monty python'    # single quotes
    $ wikidig "monty python"    # double quotes
    $ wikidig monty_python      # spaces replaced by underscores
    $ wikidig The Pythons       # another keyword

> **Query:** monty python
>
>
> **Summary:**
>
> Monty Python (sometimes known as The Pythons) was a British surreal comedy
> group who created Monty Python's Flying Circus, a British television comedy
> sketch show that first aired on the BBC on 5 October 1969. Forty-five
> episodes were made over four series. The Python phenomenon developed from the
> television series into something larger in scope and impact, spawning

If wikidig couldn't find any summary, the summary and source field will be left
empty.

> Sometimes, the wikipedia DNS might be too busy, leaving you with an empty
> summary, you can re-run the command again to ensure if there wasn't such a
> summary with the given queries found.

## Installation
To install wikidig, you can use `make`, wich is by default already provided on
most Unix systems. There's no build target, so you can immediately install it
by passing:

    $ [sudo] make install

Optionally, you can override several variables:

    ===========================================================================
    | EXE    | The name of the installed executable, useful if you have       |
    |        | already an executable called snippy and want to rename this    |
    |        | executable to something different (such as qwiki or so).       |
    +--------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
    | PREFIX | The prefix for installation, this defaults to /usr/local/, so  |
    |        | the content of the bin/ directory will be then copied to       |
    |        | /usr/local/bin/ and so on. This is useful if you want to       |
    |        | install it under virtual environment.                          |
    ===========================================================================

For example, if you want to install it under prefix /usr/, just pass:

    $ [sudo] make install PREFIX=/usr/

### Debugging
You can also install it under 'development mode', this is mainly useful if you
want to debug the program:

    $ [sudo] make develop

> After debugging, you might want to re-install the program. To do so, you'll
> have to uninstall it first (even if it was installed under development mode),
> this can be done with the uninstall target:
>
>     $ [sudo] make uninstall
